# hello-world

Hi, People!

I am Vanessa, I like web programming! 
And I'm here to learn and meet some people who can help me to be a better developer. 
I started a new job a few months ago, more precisely seven months, and I am loving 
to be a developer and represent the gender. Ok, I'm in the very beginning of developing, 
and my english is very poor and not to good as I would like to be, but I am a fast learning
when I'm intresting in the subject. 

Sorry 'bout my english and thanks for read this little presentation that I make.
